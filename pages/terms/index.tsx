      <h4>SERVICE AGREEMENT</h4>

      <p>
        AG Logia Photography is committed to providing top quality services &
        customer support in a timely & friendly manner. In order to ensure that
        we can continue doing so, we need to be confident that our clients
        understand and agree to our company’s service agreement. By placing an
        services from us, you agree to the following terms:
      </p>

      <h4>Scheduling and Turnaround Times</h4>

      <p>
        "Work" hereafter refers to any photography, videography/videos, and
        another artistic and intellectual property created for Client by AG
        Logia Photography. We requires a minimum turnaround time of 24 hours for
        photos, and 72 hours videos, floor plans, and panoramas. This time
        commences from the time we have completed the work on-site. Weekends or
        holidays are not counted; turnaround times shall apply only to business
        days/hours. For example, if we agree to shoot a property on a weekend or
        holiday, we will commence the turnaround timing on the first business
        day that follows. Client understands that the turnaround times cannot be
        changed unless agreed upon in writing by AG Logia. If time permits and
        we agrees to expedite the work in less than the original agreed upon
        time, then a premium may be charged. If a return trip is requested, such
        as for twilight photos, the turnaround time is reset upon completing the
        shoot on the return arrival to property. (For example, if we arrive to a
        property to shoot photos at 3pm and finish the shoot at 5pm, Client will
        receive those photos at 5pm next day. However, if Client requests a
        return trip for twilight photos, for example, and our team returns to
        the property at 8pm and finishes the shoot at 9pm, then those twilight
        photos will be ready by 9pm the next day. Feature sheets are printed and
        picked up 48 hours only after client agrees to design/layout.
      </p>

      <p>
        The Shoot If our photographer arrives to the property and does not have
        access to shoot the property (whether via lock-box or agent/owner)
        within a reasonable time (5-10 minutes) or if the property is not ready
        or available to be photographed, Client will be charged $60 plus travel
        (see “Travel” below). Unless specifically requested by the client, we
        will assume discretion in selecting which rooms or views to photograph.
        if the room was not staged up and the client still wish to have the
        pictures taken, we will follow the order. We will not wait the client to
        move things around during the shooting.
